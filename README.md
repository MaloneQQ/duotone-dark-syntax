# DuoTone dark

A double-hue syntax theme for Atom.

DuoTone themes use only 2 hues (8 shades in total). It __tones down__ less important parts (like punctuation and brackets) and highlights only the __important__ ones. This leads to a more calm color scheme, but still lets you find the stuff you're looking for.


## Language support

DuoTone themes are optimized for many languages:

> C, Clojure, CoffeeScript, C#, CSS, GF Markdown, Go, Haskell, HTML, Java, JavaScript, JSON, Less, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, SASS, SCSS, Stylus, XML, YAML...

See the list of [all languages](https://github.com/simurai/duotone-syntax/tree/master/styles/languages).

## Install

Search for `duotone-dark-syntax` in Atom's settings. Or install via CL:

```
apm install duotone-dark-syntax
```


## Settings

You can change the color scheme by going to `Settings > Themes > duotone-dark-syntax Theme` (or the cog icon next to the theme picker). There you can customize the main and accent color.
